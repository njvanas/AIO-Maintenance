# AIO-Maintenance
AIO Maintenance is an AI-developed tool that centralizes and manages frequently used PowerShell and CMD scripts. It includes custom scripts Iâ€™ve created and others curated online, offering IT professionals a streamlined way to view, edit, and use scripts in one convenient space.

# How to Use
**Method 1:**
To use this tool and change it as you please, you can either install Python to your machine from the official website **"HERE"**, download the AIOMaintenance.py file and double click it to run the app.

**Method 2 (easiest):**
Download the AIO Maintenance.exe file **"HERE"** and run it. :)

# IMPORTANT NOTES
**Antivirus:** Two of the pre-created scripts might get **flagged as false positives by your Antivirus** due to it using a known work around to activate Windows and Office for free. You are free to remove the scripts out of the code in the .py file before it auto generates the scripts.

**Locations:** All scripts are placed in the "C:\BAT" folder and if it does not exist it will create this folder for you. When adding a script to the tool it will automatically place the script in this location. Error logs are written to "C:\BAT\Error", however I have never encountered many errors with these scripts thus it might be a bit buggy.

# I AINT NO DEV
**AI is Cool:** I have absolutely no knowledge with coding at all. I understand some of the terminology, worked with SQL databases in the past and have my MCSA DBA accreditation but at heart I am a techy. I have never coded any app or tool and don't plan to honestly, I am just doing some fun projects on the side with the help of AI.
